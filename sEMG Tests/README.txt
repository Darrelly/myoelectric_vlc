This folder contains the code to test the accuracy of the classification algorithm.

Three different tests were performed. The tests differed from one another based on the sensors and the type of communication channel used. The three tests are:

1) 4 sEMG sensors via direct wired connection to serial port
2) 4 sEMG sensors with XBee communication channel
3) 4 sEMG sensors with accelerometer

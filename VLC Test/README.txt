This folder contains three different experiments.

First, an experiment was carried out to characterize the linear operating region of the LED being used in this project. The code can be found in the 'Characterizing LED' folder.

Second, an experiment was carried out to measure the range of the VLC in terms of signal-to-noise ratio and receiver output. The measurements for this test are found in VLC_range.m.

Lastly, an experiment was carried out to measure the bit error rate of the VLC channel across multiple distances. This experiment was performed at distances of 5 cm, 10 cm, and 15 cm. The code for the test as well as the results of the test are in the 'BER Test' folder.
